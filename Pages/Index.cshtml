    <h6>
        The main goal of this software tool is to automatically recognise and allocate visual patterns (such as words, drawings and seals) in digitised manuscripts. The recall-precision
    balance of detected patterns can be controlled visually, and the detected patterns can be saved as annotations on the original images or as cropped images depending on the needs of users.

        Please pay attention to the following limitations:
    </h6>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The required computational resources depend on your data. Detecting several patterns concurrently can exhaust your computer memory, and searching
            in huge datasets is limited by your storage capacity and your browser upload settings.
        </li>

        <li>
            This version provides best results of pattern detection when applied to datasets with relatively similar image qualities, such as resolution, degradation level, rotation, etc. an examples of
            such datasets are manuscripts that have been digitised under similar conditions and using similar equipements. Future releases will provide higher tolerance levels with respect to these
            aspects.
        </li>

        <li>
            This version has a limited capacity of benefiting from a large number of examples for the same pattern. Future releases will generate pattern models adaptively so that it gets better
            with every additional pattern example.
