# Visual-Pattern Detector (VPD)

The VPD is an efficient and easy-to-use software tool for pattern detection. This tool can be used to recognise and allocate visual patterns (such as words, drawings and seals) automatically in digitised manuscripts. The recall-precision balance of detected patterns can be controlled visually, and the detected patterns can be saved as annotations on the original images or as cropped images depending on the needs of users.
